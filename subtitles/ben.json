{"text": " So the Dunkin Donuts that I normally walk past and when I arrive back from getting the train from Manhattan and getting off at Halsey Street is all shut up to give you an idea of what time it is. I am walking home whilst he did say that it should be my first take and it should be whatever comes from that first take. I actually am recording this a second time because the last time I did it I recorded it through my AirPods and I don't know what happened but the Bluetooth messed up. I should have known better than to trust that Viking, those Vikings, but whatever happened it didn't work so now I'm doing it the old fashion way as I walk down the street and holding my phone in front of my mouth like a normal person. What I talked about yesterday I don't know it doesn't really matter anymore not only is it 24 hours behind but also it doesn't it doesn't occur to me anymore. I was talking about banana skins I was talking about puddles and the curbside that I'm walking down right now because I'm walking from a different subway stop there's nothing. There's no bananas I don't see any puddles it's dry. The only thing that's on the street is cigarette butts so I gotta find something else to talk about. Today was quite a cyclical day whatever that means. I feel like I began at the same place I ended. I'm gonna cross the street which make of it what you will but I think a cyclical day is a good day. The flags are flying above my head and there's a lot of furniture on the street not not in a good way well I mean maybe it's in a good way who knows furniture will be what it will be and so today I had a lot of conversations I had a lot actually yeah I had a lot of conversations today unexpectedly large amount of conversations with people that sometimes I knew and also sometimes I didn't know sometimes it was random strangers in a museum and sometimes it was people actually sometimes it was today you know what today was full of conversations of people who I had met on a maximum amount of maybe two or three times and I mean it doesn't what does it mean what does it mean these days when when you actually meet someone twice in real life does it matter like does that count for anything I don't know but either way that's the kind of like genre of meetings that I've had today and I'm not gonna I'm gonna rank them in any order they were all individual and interesting in their own way but I had a lovely conversation with someone who I didn't know who was showing his grandmother around a museum and he had coded something that was in the museum and I don't know I saw myself in this person and it was kind of that was kind of beautiful the enthusiasm that this this guy had for this pen plotter that was in this museum and then okay so that was one silent conversation a beautiful serendipitous moment with a stranger who had created something that I was pining over and then other conversations I had were with people that I had met a handful of times but were deep interesting conversations about what it means to make things in digital worlds today so as I stroll back on my evening tonight I'm now on Bainbridge Street approaching my my casa there's a party going on next door and approaching my house I'm gonna leave you with I'm gonna leave you with the the voice of the door as I type in the number what will happen door open", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.5, "text": " So the Dunkin Donuts that I normally walk past and when I arrive back from", "tokens": [50364, 407, 264, 47183, 259, 1468, 3648, 300, 286, 5646, 1792, 1791, 293, 562, 286, 8881, 646, 490, 51039], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.24946210191056534, "compression_ratio": 1.2894736842105263, "no_speech_prob": 0.1794983446598053}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 13.5, "end": 19.32, "text": " getting the train from Manhattan and getting off at Halsey Street is all", "tokens": [51039, 1242, 264, 3847, 490, 23633, 293, 1242, 766, 412, 13896, 7399, 7638, 307, 439, 51330], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.24946210191056534, "compression_ratio": 1.2894736842105263, "no_speech_prob": 0.1794983446598053}, {"id": 2, "seek": 1932, "start": 19.32, "end": 32.08, "text": " shut up to give you an idea of what time it is.
